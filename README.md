## Properties

| name             | type            | default | description                                 |
|------------------|-----------------|---------|---------------------------------------------|
| transitionDuration | number       | 200     | Defines the speed of the animation of positioning and transforming.|
| limitZoom       | number, "original image size" | "original image size" | Limit the maximum available scale. By default, the maximum scale is calculated based on the original image size. |
| minScale         | number          | 0       | Limit the minimum acceptable scale. With a value of 1, it is recommended to use this parameter with `limitPan` |
| autoZoomOut    | boolean         | false   | Automatic restoration of the original size of an image after its zooming in by two fingers.|
| doubleTap       | boolean         | true    | Zooming in and zooming out of an image, depending on its current condition, with double tap.|
| disabled         | boolean         | false   | Disable zoom. |
| disablePan       | boolean         | false   | Turn off panning with one finger. |
| overflow         | "hidden", "visible" | "hidden" | `hidden` - the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible. `visible` - the overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box. |
| disableZoomControl | "disable", "never", "auto" | "auto" | Disable zoom controls. `auto` - Disable zoom controls on touch screen devices. `never` - show zoom controls on all devices. `disable` - disable zoom controls on all devices. |
| zoomControlScale | number          | 1       | Zoom factor when using zoom controls. |
| backgroundColor  | string          | "rgba(0,0,0,0.85)" | The background color of the container. |
| limitPan         | boolean         | false   | Stop panning when the edge of the image reaches the edge of the screen. |
| listeners        | "auto", "mouse and touch" | "mouse and touch" | By default, subscriptions are made for mouse and touch screen events. The value `auto` means that the subscription will be only for touch events or only for mouse events, depending on the type of screen. |
| wheel            | boolean         | true    | Scale with the mouse wheel. |
| wheelZoomFactor  | number          | 0.2     | Zoom factor when zoomed in with the mouse wheel. |
| autoHeight       | boolean         | false   | Calculate the height of the container based on the `width` and `height` attributes of the image. By default, the width of the container is 100%, and the height is determined after the image information is loaded - this may cause a delay in determining the height of the container. If you want the container to initially have dimensions corresponding to the dimensions of the image, then specify the attributes `width` and `height` for the `<img>` tag. When setting the property value to `true`, a subscription to the window resize listener will be created. |
| draggableImage   | boolean         | true    | Sets the attribute `draggable` to the `<img>` tag. |
